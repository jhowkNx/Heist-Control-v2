## Welcome to Heist Control v2

## Heist Control is a script that was originally born for the 2Take1 Menu

- Its main function is to improve the way in which heists can be made, completed or improved using specific functions for such situations.
- One of its most used features is the preset with a high payout power, offering all members of your heist the best payouts.

## Important: If you are doing your first heist, remember to do your first heist legitimately to avoid bugs like (I can't send pics to Lester from Casino Heist)
## If you encounter any problems, there is an option to revert your heist to its original state (Reset Heist)

- The term 'Preset' represents a range of various modifications made by the script automatically when you choose a preset of your choice.

## Cayo Perico Heist you will be able to
-   Complete all missions instantly
-   Change Main Target
-   Change the Secondary Target
-   Change weapons, equipment, vehicles, etc...
-   Change the members (AI) of your heists
-   Change the position of clothing, equipment and the supply truck.

## When using a preset, Heist Control sets up your heist for the best items, unlocks various specific areas of your heist.
Besides being able to equip the best members of your heist, the best weapons and also, being able to manipulate the payment of a heist... Heist Control is fully capable of helping your friends who do not have enough money to buy that favorite car or that dream yacht.

# The use of this script is at your own risk!!!

# Cayo Perico Heist

* Automated Presets

This preset is an improved version of the old "Normal Presets".
It is a totally redesigned version, everything before you start the Heist is automatic. The targets values, the percentages are fully calculated by it, you will not be able to change these settings.

The most this preset can offer you and others, is a payout within the limit of $2,550,000 every 15 minutes!

## To receive this maximum amount, the percentages must be exact to what the preset provides, members cannot die during the robbery, if they die or even restart it will cause the money to be subtracted and the payout amount will be less than desired

## The percentage of members must be followed with respect, do not try to play the method with 3 players if you intend to play in duo. This will affect the final payout.

## There are examples like
* If you intend to play solo, obviously the payout will be 100%.
* If you intend to play in duo (you and a friend) the percentage is 50% each.
* If you intend to play in trio (you and two friends) the appropriate percentage is 30% for you and 35% for your friends
* If you intend to play in squad (you and three friends) the appropriate percentage is 25% each.

## The available presets are
- SOLO
- 2 Players
- 3 Players
- 4 Players

In all these presets, the only primary targets available are: The legendary Sapphire Statue (Panther) and Ruby Necklace, both offer the same payout with only a slight variation to make it less cloying

Each preset is capable of offering the highest payout to each participating member

REMEMBER: You cannot play DUO using a preset made for SOLO or 3/4 players! 

There is a preset that is called "[1-4 Players] Quick Method".
This preset is the fastest available at the moment, with it you will only have the sub to use and recommended you choose to invade through the sewer.
And with it, there are no secondary targets, all members will receive the 2.4mil payout just by stealing the primary target. So you won't waste time

The 'Semi-Original' preset is a preset that is pretty much the original version, with minor improvements over the second loot.
The preset is not calculated, i.e. there is no way to know what the final payout of the members will be. 
But with it you are allowed to use a range of functions available in the script, but you must respect the payment limit, with it you must make a calculation to not exceed the limit and have the payment denied in the end.
