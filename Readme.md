# Heist Control v2

## Heist Control is a LUA Script originally designed for the 2Take1 Menu.

- What is "Heist Control"?
     - The name says it, you will be able to take full control of your heist.

- Heist Control is able to set up your heist in just one click. No longer will you have to do some boring setups to play your favorite heist, Heist Control will do it for you.

## Important: If you are doing your first heist, remember to do your first heist legitimately to avoid bugs like (I can't send picks to Lester from Casino Heist)
## If you encounter any problems, there is an option to revert your heist to its original state (Reset Heist)

- The term 'Preset' represents a range of various modifications made by the script automatically when you choose a preset of your choice.

## Cayo Perico Heist you will be able to
-   Complete all missions instantly
-   Change Main Target
-   Change the Secondary Target
-   Change weapons, equipment, vehicles, etc...
-   Change the members (AI) of your heists
-   Change the position of clothing, equipment and the supply truck.
-   Change and fully unlock the main vehicle to start the heist
-   Change the percentage and payment of each member in your heist
 and much more!

## When using a preset, Heist Control sets up your heist for the best items, unlocks various specific areas of your heist.
Besides being able to equip the best members of your heist, the best weapons and also, being able to manipulate the payment of a heist... Heist Control is fully capable of helping your friends who do not have enough money to buy that favorite car or that dream yacht.

* How does Heist Control affect my game?

It only changes some stats, its entire function is based on GTA Online's own stats.

* Can I be banned for changing some stats?

Yes, you can.


There are no reports of bans during the use or involvement with Heist Control, since the v1 version has proven safe for the time being.


This project is free. I do not recommend paying for this script if you found it on some random forum on the internet.

To continue developing, improving and adding more functions to Heist Control, this requires my 2TAKE1 Menu license to be active and this generates costs.

# Cayo Perico Heist

* Automated Presets

This preset is an improved version of the old "Normal Presets".
It is a totally redesigned version, everything before you start the Heist is automatic. The targets values, the percentages are fully calculated by it, you will not be able to change these settings.

The most this preset can offer you and others, is a payout within the limit of $2,550,000 every 15 minutes!

## To receive this maximum amount, the percentages must be exact to what the preset provides, members cannot die during the robbery, if they die or even restart it will cause the money to be subtracted and the payout amount will be less than desired

## The percentage of members must be followed with respect, do not try to play the method with 3 players if you intend to play in duo. This will affect the final payout.

## There are examples like
* If you intend to play solo, obviously the payout will be 100%.
* If you intend to play in duo (you and a friend) the percentage is 50% each.
* If you intend to play in trio (you and two friends) the appropriate percentage is 30% for you and 35% for your friends
* If you intend to play in squad (you and three friends) the appropriate percentage is 25% each.

## The available presets are
- SOLO
- 2 Players
- 3 Players
- 4 Players

In all these presets, the only primary targets available are: The legendary Sapphire Statue (Panther) and Ruby Necklace, both offer the same payout with only a slight variation to make it less cloying

Each preset is capable of offering the highest payout to each participating member

REMEMBER: You cannot play DUO using a preset made for SOLO or 3/4 players! 

There is a preset that is called "[1-4 Players] Quick Method".
This preset is the fastest available at the moment, with it you will only have the sub to use and recommended you choose to invade through the sewer.
And with it, there are no secondary targets, all members will receive the 2.4mil payout just by stealing the primary target. So you won't waste time

The 'Semi-Original' preset is a preset that is pretty much the original version, with minor improvements over the second loot.
The preset is not calculated, i.e. there is no way to know what the final payout of the members will be. 
But with it you are allowed to use a range of functions available in the script, but you must respect the payment limit, with it you must make a calculation to not exceed the limit and have the payment denied in the end.

## Custom Teleport
The name says it, able to offer you resources to make the Heist as fast as possible

## Advanced options
The advanced options contain a few items:

## Players Cut
- Allows you to modify the percentage of each member in your heist
- Note: If you add a percentage much higher than normal, obviously you will not receive anything

## Bag Modifier
- Allows you to exceed the default limit when collecting the secondary target in your bag (this function only affects you)

## Remove Fencing Fee & Pavel Cut
As the name says, it removes the discounts on the final payout of your heist (it is not recommended to use this option in automatic presets)

## Approach Vehicles

* Here you can choose between just one and all vehicles that will be available to you during the Heist.

## Primary Target

All primary targets on the list, plus the exclusive item 'Sapphire Panther' which should probably appear normally for a few times.

## Secondary Target

* This function has recently been changed as it would affect the way the insta-play presets work and negatively affect the payout calculations for each member.

## Change Weapons

* You can choose which group of weapons you will use in the heist.

## Equipment Location

* Do you want all items to spawn near el rubyo's mansion? Yes, that is possible! There are also other locations available to you.

## Supply Truck Location

* Yes, you can also change where you want the truck to appear during your Heist.

## Heist Difficulty

* Choose between normal and hard difficulty.

## Cayo Perico Awards

* You can also unlock all trophies, achievements and more..

## Complete the missions (only)

## Force of longest final cutscene
- Forces you to watch a long final cutscene (trevor)

## Set Heist to Default (Reset)
- In case of bugs, with it you are able to roll back most of the process done by the script

## Remove Repeat Cooldown
- Not so useful option since it is not able to circumvent the payment cooldown (15 minutes)
