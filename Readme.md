# Heist Control (v2)

## Heist Control is a LUA Scrit. Made just to work with the 2TAKE1 Menu. 
### I do not offer support if you are using this script in another menu.

### The main function of Heist Control is to immediately prepare your Heist, allowing you to get the best items such as weapons, equipment, cars, and team members.  Removing the need to redo missions, collect items at various points on the map, and more.
### What we can't forget either, is the powerful function to help your friends to earn money "honestly".

### Attention: There is a cooldown that affects all Heists, this cooldown of 15 minutes is for high value payments that the Heist Control can offer, so if you want to restart (repeat) the heist with your friends, I recommend that after the end of each Heist, you wait about 15 minutes (in real life) for the next payment to be made on your account (or on your friends').

# The use of this tool is entirely your responsibility, the use can bring risks to your account permanently.


* How does Heist Control affect my game?

It only changes some stats, its entire function is based on GTA Online's own stats.

* Can I be banned for changing some stats?

Yes, you can.


### There are no reports of bans during the use or involvement with Heist Control, since the v1 version has proven safe for the time being.


### This project is free. I do not recommend paying for this script if you found it on some random forum on the internet.

### To continue developing, improving and adding more functions to Heist Control, this requires my 2TAKE1 Menu license to be active and this generates costs. 
You can also help me with any kind of donation via paypal.
You can contact me by Discord (jhowkNx#0392)

### It was developed especially and exclusively for working with 2TAKE1 Menu. 

# Cayo Perico Heist

* Insta-Play (Presets)

This is the function that allows you to quickly play any Cayo Perico heist, without paying for preparations, missions and such things. Some presets already have the values (in %) calculated for each member of your Heist and these values cannot be higher or lower. This can directly affect the payment you will receive in the end.

## The available presets are

* Normal: Which can be used any day.
* Event: Which should only be used while Rockstar activates the weekly event: 50% bonus for payments.

## Each Preset has a maximum value assigned

* Normal: $2,550,000 (per person)
* Event: $4,100,000 (per person)

## To receive this maximum amount, the percentages must be exact to what the menu provides, members cannot die during the robbery, if they die or even restart it will cause the money to be subtracted and the payout amount will be less than desired

## The percentage of members must be followed with respect, do not try to play the method with 3 players if you intend to play in duo. This will affect the final payout.

## There are examples like
* If you intend to play solo, obviously the payout will be 100%.
* If you intend to play in duo (you and a friend) the percentage is 50% each.
* If you intend to play in trio (you and two friends) the appropriate percentage is 20% for you and 40% for your friends
* If you intend to play in squad (you and three friends) the appropriate percentage is 25% each.

## If you try to add 85% for your friend and 15% for you using these presets, your friend will not receive any money, so please correctly follow the percentage presented by the script.


## Approach Vehicles

* Here you can choose between just one and all vehicles that will be available to you during the Heist.

## Primary Target

All primary targets on the list, plus the exclusive item 'Sapphire Panther' which should probably appear normally for a few times.

## Secondary Target

* This function has recently been changed as it would affect the way the insta-play presets work and negatively affect the payout calculations for each member.

## Change Weapons

* You can choose which group of weapons you will use in the heist.

## Equipment Location

* Do you want all items to spawn near el rubyo's mansion? Yes, that is possible! There are also other locations available to you.

## Supply Truck Location

* Yes, you can also change where you want the truck to appear during your Heist.

## Heist Difficulty

* Choose between normal and hard difficulty.

## Remove Repeat Cooldown

Unfortunately, after the success of some 'Heist Repeaters' Rockstar has added a server-side feature that are only allowed to pay every 15 minutes in real life.
The Remove Repeat can be useful if you already want to anticipate the progress of the Heist and wait for your 15 minutes to start again

## Set Heist to Default

Useful if you encounter any incompatibility problems or even a strange bug

This removes the payment that is deducted for each crew member at the end of the Heist. This will make sure that you receive the maximum of what you got during the heist.}
